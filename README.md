# Learning Requirements
Requirements are what constitutes the scope of the project. All requirements that are not written, well understood, shared and accepted by stakeholders are not part of the scope. 
In this section you will learn about requirements and the Use case tool that we utilize when documenting the requirements.

## Exercises

### What are the requirements for the application Paint
In order to complete this exercise you should have knowledge about 
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- FURPS

Paint is a utility installed with Windows. It's a program that enables the user to draw on a naked canvas or redesign existing images.

In this excercise you will analyse Paint and write down a portion of the requirements that would enable developers do implement a new version of Paint with same functionality.

Use FURPS to categorize the requirements. The requirements should be written as short headlines eg. "save canvas".

### Write a Fully dressed Use Case
In order to complete the following exercise you should have knowledge about
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- FURPS
- Fully dressed use cases 

Select one of the requirements from the previous exercise. The requirement selected should have some complexity eg. "save canvas" or "restore canvas". Detail the requirement so it conforms to the fully dressed use case template presented earlier.

### Use case testing
In order to complete the following exercise you should have knowledge about
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- FURPS
- Fully dressed use cases
- testing use cases

Let another user test (tester) the use case you wrote in the previous exercise. As a facilator you should use follow this flow:
1. Present your self and what you whish to accomplish
2. Introduce the tester to the use case
3. Explain the success scenario to the tester
4. Hand over the use case to the tester. Explain to the tester that he or she should put words on his or hers actions.
5. Let the test begin

Make notes as the tester perform actions

### Project
With a sound understanding of requirements and the utilization of use cases, you are now able to begin scoping your software project.
All written, understood, shared and accepted requirements makes the scope of the project.
