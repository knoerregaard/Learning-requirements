## Exercises

### What are the requirements for the application Paint
In order to complete this exercise you should have knowledge about 
- Functional and non-functional requirements
- FURPS

Paint is a utility installed with Windows. It's a program that enables the user to draw on a naked canvas or redesign existing images.

In this excercise you will analyse Paint and write down a portion of the requirements that would enable developers do implement a new version of Paint with same functionality.

Use FURPS to categorize the requirements. The requirements should be written as short headlines eg. "save canvas".
